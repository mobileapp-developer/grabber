# 🍏 Grabber Grocery App

This is a mobile application for browsing, searching, and managing grocery products, inspired by the Grabber Grocery App Figma design. The app is built with [Expo](https://expo.dev) using TypeScript and modern React Native development practices.

## About This App

It features a clean, user-friendly interface and is ideal as a template or starting point for grocery, food delivery, or e-commerce mobile applications. The project demonstrates best practices in Expo, React Native, and TypeScript, and is based on a community Figma design.
