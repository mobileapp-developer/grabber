# 🍏 Mobile Testing App

This is a mobile application built with [Expo](https://expo.dev), using TypeScript and modern React Native development practices.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

You can open the app in:
- [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go)

## 📁 Project Structure

- `app/` — main app logic and screens (file-based routing)
- `components/` — reusable UI components
- `constants/` — static data for cards, categories, fruits
- `types/` — TypeScript types for props and data
- `assets/` — images and fonts

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Expo + React Native
- TypeScript
- File-based routing

## 📝 Development
